== Introduction
Awesomest Dive Log is a dive log for tracking dives.
It provides a simple one stop way for divers to input details of their dive and keep track of their nitrogen levels.
This allows divers to plan their next trip safely.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Dive Log.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add l/LOCATION`, `LOCATION` is a parameter which can be used as `add l/Sentosa`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a dive session: `add`
Adds a dive session to the Dive Log.

Format: `add ds/DATE_STARTED ts/TIME_DIVE_STARTED de/DATE_ENDED te/TIME_DIVE_ENDED ss/SAFETY_STOP  d/DEPTH  l/LOCATION pg/INITIAL_PRESSURE_GROUP pge/FINAL_PRESSURE_GROUP`

TIP: Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters, items in SQUARE_BRACKETS are optional. Order of parameters are fixed.

Put a `ts/` before the time started(24 hours format - HHMM), te/time ended (24 hours format - HHMM), d/depth (in metres), l/ location (location name), per dive at v1.0) (optional) and pg/initial pressure group, pge/final pressure group.

_Example:
add ds/04082018 ts/0900 de/04082018  te/1020 ss/1015 d/15 l/Bukit Lagoon pg/C pge/F tz/+8_

|=========================================

=== Listing all dives : `list`

Shows a list of all dives in the dive log. +
Format: `list`

=== Editing a dive : `edit`

Edits an existing dive session in the Dive Log. +
Format: `edit INDEX [ts/TIME_START] [te/TIME_END] [ss/SAFETY_STOP_TIME] [d/DEPTH] [pg/PG_AT_START][pge/PG_AT_END][l/LOCATION]...`

****
* Edits the dive at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed dive list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

Examples:
`edit 1 pge/F l/Tioman`

=== Locating dives by location: `find`

Finds dives whose location contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `tioman` will match `Tioman`
* Only the location is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
****

Examples:

* `find Bali` +
Returns `Dive at Bali`

=== Deleting a dive : `delete`
Deletes the specified dive from the Dive Log. +
Format: `delete INDEX`

****
* Deletes the dive at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed dive list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd dive in the Dive Log.
* `find Bali` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st dive in the results of the `find` command.

=== Selecting a diveSession : `select`

Selects the dive identified by the index number used in the displayed dive list. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****
* Selects the dive and loads the details of the dive at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed diveSession list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`

Examples:

* `list` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd dive in the Dive Log.

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the Dive Log's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +

`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the Dive Log. +
Format: `clear`

WARNING: Once you cleared all entries, your data will not be recoverable

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +

=== Saving the data

Luckily for you, your Dive Log data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.



== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Dive Log folder.
