== PROJECT: DiveLog

== Overview

DiveLog is a desktop dive log application for divers to calculate their blood nitrogen levels prior to conducting dives.
It was built to help divers plan so as to minimise the risk of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness[decompression sickness]. Divers interact with
divelog through a simple command line interface. Divers can add their dives and the system will warn them if its too
deep or too long.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *consistency check between dives*
** What it does: When a dive is added or edited, one must always check whether the dive is valid or not.
One must also check that the addition or change in parameters of the dive does not make the subsequent dives to risky to attempt.
** Justification: This feature is critical for the functioning of the divelog as the individual nitrogen levels depend on the previous dives
** Highlights: This enhancement affects both the `add` and `edit` command.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** added a `set_units` command
** Integration of timezones into calculations
** Morphed the UI and Model to make it work

* *Code contributed*: https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=arjo129&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-04&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[RepoSense Dashboard]
