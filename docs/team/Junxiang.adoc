== CS2113T Project: DiveLog
== Overview

*DiveLog* is a desktop application that mainly uses CLI as a user interface. Dive Log provides a simple way for underwater divers to input details of their dives such as the time they spent at a particular depth, and the application will keep track of their nitrogen levels.
This allows divers to plan their next trip safely.

Dive Log is able to calculate accurately the diverâ€™s current Blood Nitrogen Composition, which is used to evaluate when it will be safe to dive again, and for how long.


== Summary of contributions
* *Code Contributed* [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=cjunxiang&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-02&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[Cjunx]]

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented a *Planning Mode*
** What it does: This feature allows users to be able to plan for future dives without the fear of corrupting their current data.
When the users exit planning mode, the data is restored to before when entered planning mode.
If the user wants to transfer planning data to normal mode, the user can use `portover` command.
** Justification: This is a major feature of the app as divers often want to plan their dives ahead of their trips. This
also helps to reduce the instance where divers cannot board a plane ride due to
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: Created Time, OurDate parameters in a `DiveSession` and a helper class `CompareUtils`. The two parameters
are crucial in logging a dive, and also in calculations of Pressure Groups which is the main feature of our app. `CompareUtils`
contain methods that help
