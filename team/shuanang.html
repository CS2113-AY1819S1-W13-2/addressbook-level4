<p>Divelog is a command line driven desktop dive log application for divers to calculate their blood nitrogen levels prior to conducting dives, without the need of a physical PADI recreational dive planner.
It was built to help divers plan so as to minimise the risk of decompression sickness. The app was originally based on <a href="https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4">Addressbook level 4</a> and
written as part of the requirements for NUS CS2113T in semester 1 of AY2018/2019.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the logic to calculate pressure groups automatically</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: allows the diver to relieve himself/herself of the PADI recreational diving planner by automating the calculation of his/her pressure group at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a recreational diver traditionally physically carries along the PADI recreational dive planner with him/her on dive trips. Calculating pressure groups is also error-prone as it is done manually, under the constant pressure from the sea surroundings. By automating the calculation of the pressure group for new and repetitive dives, the diver will be safer when planning for other dives than when he/she calculates it by himself/herself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement is the heart of the Divelog application, which affects the safety of the divers directly. In order to complete this function, I had to thoroughly read and understand a 36-page long document from PADI to get a complex understanding on what pressure groups are, how tedious the calculation is behind the scene, and how pressure groups affects the safety of recreational divers.  It required an in-depth analysis of the three tables in the PADI recreational diving planner, as all three of them are needed especially for repetitive dives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credits: PADI</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added a currentpg command that allows the diver to be aware of his/her current pressure group at any time, based on his/her latest dive. The command also tells them the time needed to the next pressure group and to the minimum pressure group "A" so they can plan their next dive accordingly, as well as a safe time for them such that they can start taking a flight.</p>

the diver would find the depth (19) at the top row. There is no 19 metres in the table, so the closest rounded-up value is 20 metres. He would then go down that 20m column until he finds 29 minutes,
or the closest rounded up value which is 30 minutes. The diver will then draw his finger along the row to the left to match a character, which is "M". His new pressure group is now "M".</p>

2.   For the diver&#8217;s second and subsequent repetitive dives of the day, he would have to refer to table 3 in <a href="#Diagram_11">[Diagram_11]</a> (Repetitive Dive Timetable) to find out his total bottom time. The diver wants to dive to 10 metres for 15 minutes for his second dive.
The diver has already surfaced for three hours, which is the minimum time for any pressure group to reach the minimum "A" pressure group, as per Table 2 in <a href="#Diagram_10">[Diagram_10]</a> (Surface Interval Credit Table). However, there will still be residual nitrogen in his body after three hours as long as the diver makes a dive within six hours of his previous dive, and thus he has to find out his residual nitrogen time from the previous dive.
Finding his current pressure group "A" on the top row of Table 3, he would match the depth he wants to dive to (10m), and get the values 10 at the top (in the white area) and 209 at the bottom (in the blue area).
10 minutes refer the Residual Nitrogen Time (RNT) and 209 minutes refer to the adjusted no decompression limits. The diver has to add the RNT value (10) to his intended/Actual Bottom Time (ABT) (15 minutes), giving a total of 25 minutes
Total Bottom Time (TBT). Do pay special attention to this: He will only be diving for 15 minutes, however he has to account for the residual nitrogen time in his body, so his TBT is 25 minutes. Going back to Table 1 in <a href="#Diagram_10">[Diagram_10]</a>, for a depth of 10 metres and 25 minutes TBT, his new pressure group would be "C".</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As described in the activity diagram shown below, calculating the end pressure group of a new (first) dive only requires the depth and the time of the dive, and Table 1 of the PADI recreational dive planner. In the case of a new dive, the actual bottom time is equals to the total bottom time since there is no residual nitrogen in the body, and hence there is no need to know the starting pressure group since it will be "A" naturally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two exceptions will be thrown along the way if - 1. If the depth given is beyond the scope of the recreational dive planner (i.e. 43 metres and beyond) as a dive beyond 42 metres will be a decompression dive. 2. For a valid depth, if the no decompression limit is exceeded, the dive will become a decompression dive and is out of scope of planning recreational dives.</p>

<p>After finishing a dive, divers may want to go for a repetitive dive, and so they have to check for their pressure group after a certain amount of time spent on land. The activity diagram shown below shows that calculating the pressure group after a surface interval requires the end pressure group of their last dive, and the time they spent on land. If they had spent more than three hours on land, their current pressure group would reach the minimum "A". If not, then they would have to refer to Table 2 of the recreational dive planner.</p>

<p>For a repetitive dive, the divers would need to take note of the Adjusted no decompression limit (ANDL) at the depth they intend to dive at, by taking into account their residual nitrogen time (RNT) and adding it to their total bottom time - such that the dive remains a no decompression (recreational) dive. They would then run their new total bottom time with the intended depth through the first dive pressure group calculation, to get their new pressure group.</p>
